        One of the team's star defenders, nothing gets past Leilani. The opposing
        team's forwards have been known to resign after seeing her on the roster.
        She also dables as a forward, her participation in run for your life giving
        her the speed and stamina to play both sides of the field.

        With his rugged European looks and quick feet, Aaron is a soccer natural.
        Not only that, he is also one of the teams top suppliers of shin guards.
        Some of us litteraly couldn't play without him.

        Dallin is one of the foundation stones of our rock solid defense. Despite
        having offensive potential, he gave up the glory of scoring and took an
        oath to protect the goal with his life.

        Have you heard of Messi? Ronaldo? Josh puts them all to shame. With
        unlimited energy due to his participation in run for your life, Josh
        combines speed and stamina with a ruthless ability to fake out defenders.
        With a running tally of 6 broken ankles to date for the opponents, we
        might have to tell him to slow things down.

       Future potential significant other of the famous Marin,
        Emily started the season with some amazing stats.
        She has yet to play in a game without scoring a hat trick,
        and never has any offensive player ever gotten past what
        soccer analysts are beginning to refer to “The wall”.
        Self-appointed team captain, Emily demanded the leadership
        role after her brother was megged in their ginga boyzzz matchup.
